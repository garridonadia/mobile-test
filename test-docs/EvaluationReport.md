Issues

1- I thing that the user experience could be improved by adding for example, data validation messages
or a message when the search returns no results.

2- For performance enhancement, I think that loading and filtering of cities list could be improved by
dividing data in chunks and retrieving them when the users scroll or filter the list instead of
loading all cities at once.
